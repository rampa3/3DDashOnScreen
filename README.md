# 3D Dash On Screen

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that replaces 2D overlay dash in Screen mode with the regular 3D one.<br>
Also F4 is now the edit mode toggle button since it was removed when the freeform camera was added.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [3DDashOnScreen.dll](https://github.com/rampa3/3DDashOnScreen/releases/latest/download/3DDashOnScreen.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If everything is working, your 2D dash will be replaced with the regular one, when using Screen mode.
